<h3><strong>Game Rules:</strong></h3>

      <hr>
      <strong>Move and Capturing(Stacking):</strong><br/>
      Except 炮/包, every piece captures exactly like it moves.<br/>
      When capturing, you don't remove your opponent's piece; Instead, you stack your piece on and cover it.<br>
      Only pieces shown on top can move. Whenever a piece is moved away, the lower pieces show up again.<br/> 
      You lose (or the other wins) when your king is stacked by any piece. <br/>
      <hr>
    <strong>Height & Blockade:</strong><br/>
    The height of a piece is the number of pieces below it. <br/>
    You are only blocked by a piece of the same height; Think of you move a piece at its height, and then drop the piece at the target grid.<br/>
    When capturing, ignore the height of the target grid. That means you can always capture a piece regardless of its height!<br/>
    <strong>Example of blockades:</strong><br/>
    A height-2 傌/馬 is not blocked by any height-0 or height-1 pieces.<br/>
    A height-4 俥/車 is only blocked by a stack of pieces with height at least 4, and thus may usually attack several pieces in a row at the same time!<br/>
    A height-1 炮/包 is not blocked by any height-0 pieces. As any movement before blocked is considered a move, you cannot stop upon an opponent's piece if nothing is blocking between.<br/>
    (Remember: "Move" means you move a piece to an empty grid or above another piece of yourself;<br/>
    "Capture" means you move a piece to an opponent's piece.)<br/>
    <hr>
    <strong>Special moves of 仕/士:</strong><br/>
    When 仕/士 moves, it can always stack on any piece --- even if they are same side!<br/>
    Furthermore, when 仕/士 moves, it can carry any number of pieces right below it to a new grid.
    <hr>
    <strong> Promotion of 兵/卒:</strong><br/>
    When a 兵/卒 appears on top at the end rank, you switch its place with another non-兵/卒 piece of the same side.<br/>
    Note that you cannot select a top piece in the end rank, but you can select other pieces in the end rank.
