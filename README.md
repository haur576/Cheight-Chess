### **Game Rules**

**Movements:**  
- **兵/卒**: Moves forward only. Promote at the end rank.  
- **炮/包**: Move and capture like a cannon in Chinese Chess.  
- **傌/馬**: Move like a knight. Blocked by obstacles directly in front.  
- **俥/車**: Move like a rook: any blocks horizontally & vertically.  
- **相/象**: Move like a bishop: any blocks diagonally.  
- **仕/士**: Move one step diagonally. Has special skills.  
- **帥/將**: Moves like a king: one block in 8-neighborhood.

**Move and Capturing (Stacking):**  
- Except 炮/包, every piece captures exactly like it moves.  
- When capturing, you don't remove your opponent's piece; instead, you stack your piece on and cover it.  
- Only pieces shown on top can move. Whenever a piece is moved away, the lower pieces show up again.  
- You lose (or the other wins) when your king is stacked by any piece.

**Height & Blockade:**  
- The height of a piece is the number of pieces below it.  
- You are only blocked by a piece of the same height; think of it as moving at the same level, then dropping the piece at the target grid.  
- When capturing, ignore the height of the target grid — you can always capture regardless of height!  

**Example of blockades:**  
- A height-2 **傌/馬** is not blocked by any height-0 or height-1 pieces.  
- A height-4 **俥/車** is only blocked by a stack of pieces with height ≥ 4, and thus may often attack several pieces in a row.  
- A height-1 **炮/包** is not blocked by any height-0 pieces. Since movement before being blocked is considered a move, you cannot stop on an opponent's piece if nothing is blocking between.  

> **Terminology:**  
> - *Move* = Move a piece to an empty grid or on top of one of your own pieces.  
> - *Capture* = Move a piece onto an opponent's piece.

**Special Moves of 仕/士:**  
- When 仕/士 moves, it can always stack on any piece — even of the same side.  
- When 仕/士 moves, it can carry any number of pieces directly below it to a new grid.  

---

**Promotion of 兵/卒:**  
- When a 兵/卒 appears on top at the end rank, switch its place with another non-兵/卒 piece of the same side.  
- You cannot select a top piece in the end rank, but you can select other pieces in the end rank.
